# Traffic Lights Detection On Street Level Imagery

Fine-tuning the state of the art RT-DETR object detection architecture on street-level imagery to detect traffic Lights.
To improve model performance on small and sparsely distributed objects, it applies tiling/patch generation method on original input size images to create tiled images. Later, it leverages demonstrates how to use SAHI technique for inference.
